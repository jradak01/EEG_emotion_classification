# EEG-Based Emotion Classification

This project was created as part of the final thesis.

The project focuses on developing an application with a brain-computer interface using EEG technology such as the MindWave device. The application, built in Python with Python Dash, enables the prediction of user likes and dislikes based on the analysis of brain activities. Additionally, the KNN algorithm is utilized for this purpose.
